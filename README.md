# Russian localization of Opencart v.2.1.x
Russian translation of the administrative and client parts of CMS Opencart 2.1.x

Everyone who wishes to contribute to the translation can make pull requests, which after moderation will be merged into the main thread. You can correct translation errors and translate untranslated words and phrases, just do not make global changes in the names of basic entities and menus, since the purpose of this translation is to make it as similar as possible to the original translation of the first version of Opencart, which makes it easier for those who used it to switch.

PS: Since version 2.1.0.1 the translation files have changed slightly in structure and content, so if you need a translation for earlier versions, you can download it [here] (http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route = extension / extension / info & token = 0ba2f2af885c7f246671486357bce585 & extension_id = 21778).
